## Currently

I am a geoscientist with over 15 years of interdisciplinary experience working across research institutions, international organistations, government institutions and donor projects. My main interest is on high mountain processes related to natural hazards, water resources and resulting impacts upon communities. I use and develop geoscientific models and other datascience tools in combination with field campaigns to understand these processes and improve mapping and forecasting methods. Increasingly I am working with government institutions to support updating of hydrometerological forecasting procedures, particularly with respect to the cryosphere. I am currently working at the [WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research](http://www.slf.ch/), based in Davos, Switzerland. 

<!--<-- in the use of datascience tools, remote sensing and environmental modelling to address real-world problems. I am particularly interested in the combination of remote sensing, modeliing and in situ data to make robust predictions in various environmental domains.  -->
<!--My main research interest in cryospheric processes in High Mountain Asia. I have experience in academic and applied sectors. -->
